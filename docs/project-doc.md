# Proposal: Project Title

## Project Summary
<!--- Write a summary of your project including the project goals, broader impacts, and data sources -->

## Data Sources
<!--- List data sources, including the existing datasets and anything you are going to collect by yourself. It is expected to combine two or more data sources in your project. -->
<!--- Each dataset should be briefly explained: what kinds of data are available, who collected the dataset, how the data was collected. -->

## Expected Major Findings
<!--- List and explain what information you want to obtain in this project. Explain how valuable this project could be based on the objective discussion. You may want to list main claims and questions you want to answer through the project. -->

## Preprocessing Steps
<!--- List major preprocessing steps needed for the datasets and explain why. -->

----------
The following sections should be used for the full proposal document. These are not required for the proposal draft discussion.

## Basic Data Properties and Analysis Techniques
<!--- Based on the lectures on "Exploratory Data Analysis" and "Data and Sampling", list and explain what types of basic statistical analysis you plan to provide to give the meta information and overall picture of the datasets. -->



## Automation, Scalability, and Portability
<!--- Assume that newer datasets will become available from the same source in future, or you need to ask your colleague to inherit this project. What will be major challenges? List and explain technical and implementational practices you will use to enhance automation, scalability, and portability aspects of the project. -->

## Data Analysis and Algorithms
<!--- List and describe what types of (advanced) analysis you plan to conduct. This section should be tied back to the expected major findings. (If needed, you can update the findings section.) When selecting algorithms to obtain the analysis results, provide a brief explanation of the algorithmic properties and logic. You should clearly define the inputs and outputs of each algorithm. -->

# Analysis Outcomes
<!--- Explain the analysis you conducted and show the results. Discuss how the data, your analysis, and/or visualization can support the claims or findings. What will be the recommendations or suggestions you can make based on the results? Use bullet points, tables, and figures (if possible) to increase the readability of the document. -->

# Visualization
## Visualization Plan
<!--- List and explain what types of plots you plan to provide and what you are trying to show through the diagrams. You should explore the best way to visualize the information and message based on the lectures on visualization and related topics. It is required to have at least two interactive graphing and five static plots. -->

## Web Page Plan
<!--- Explain how many pages you will have in total and what content will be shown in each page. (Each diagram discussed above should be given a proper location in this section. Also, it is required to have (1) "Project Objective" page, which explains the main goals and data sources, and (2) "Analytical Methods" page, where you explain the major techniques used in the project and provide further references. -->
