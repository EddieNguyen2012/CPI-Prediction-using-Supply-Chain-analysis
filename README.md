# CPI Prediction using supply chain cost pass-through analysis
## Project Summary
This project aims is to explore and create a model that predict the inflation of food and beverages price using the Food and Beverages Consumer Price Index. This model can be used for monitoring material price, food price inflation, or market shifts that supports decision-making processes for companies in F&B as well as Agriculture industry. Moreover, it can give ordinary users forecasted changes (positive or negative) in food and beverages price for daily shopping routines. Ultimately, this project want to explore a new way to integrate more information to the calculation of the F&B Price Index, which may result in more accurate result than the traditional method. The proposed model will be trained using historical data of Chained Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Indices, Consumer Expenditures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Another source of data is the Received Price Indices data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide insights about the amount of revenue that farmers received per an area of crop unit. By using the supply chain pass-through cost model, we will predict the CPI by using PPI, CE, and RPI as the predictors.
